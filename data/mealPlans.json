recipe to let us know how you liked them! We love seeing your photos in the</strong><a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/groups/workweekpreppers\"><strong> Workweek Prepper's FB group</strong></a><strong> too.</strong></p><h2><strong>Swap Notes</strong></h2><p><strong>This section will help you customize the recipes based on what you have and what's available.&nbsp;</strong></p><p><strong>For the No Bake Tahini Date Bars:</strong> Dates play a pretty big part in these bars so we would not skip them. We use almonds, but sub any nut you like best! You can use your favorite nut butter in place of tahini, or use sunflower seed butter for a nut-free option. You can swap honey or agave for maple syrup, but we do not recommend using granulated sugar because you need the moisture that the liquid sweeteners provide!</p><p><strong>For the Honey Mustard Chicken/Tempeh Salad:</strong> There are so many ways to customize this salad. You can swap out the veggies, add more carbs or change up the protein. Read the <a href=\"https://wwlprogram.com/#/recipes/589\">full recipe notes</a> for a list of ingredients that will work best for you.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>For the Springy Pasta Salad:</strong> Any type of short pasta will work! You can also change up the veggies by adding broccoli, bell pepper, thinly sliced carrots, mushrooms, cherry tomatoes, radishes, yellow bell pepper, spinach, arugula, cucumber or red onion. Chickpeas, pinto beans, white beans, shredded chicken or cooked chicken sausage would all be complementary protein choices.</p><p><strong>For the Green Smoothie:</strong> We used frozen mango as the star ingredient of this green smoothie, but you can substitute any tropical fruits you want! For the brightest green color, stick to yellow or green fruits like kiwi, pineapple, peaches or mandarin oranges.&nbsp;<strong>&nbsp;</strong></p><p><strong>For the Sonoma White Bean Wraps:</strong> Substitute chicken or canned tuna for the white beans! Any chopped nut or seed you have on hand would work well in this wrap. Swap up the fruits and vegetables apples, pears, grapes, carrots or peppers.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Gluten-free swaps:</strong> Make sure your oats are GF for the no bake bars. The omni version of the honey mustard salad is gluten free as written, but if you’re making the veg/vegan version, you’ll need GF flour for the cauliflower batter! Use your favorite GF pasta for the springy pasta salad. Don’t forget to pick up your favorite GF burrito-size tortillas for the white bean wraps.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Dairy-free swaps: </strong>You’ll want to use vegan chocolate chips for the bars. If you’re making the vegetarian/vegan version of the honey mustard salad, you will need non-dairy milk for the cauliflower batter. Sub tahini for yogurt in the springy pasta salad. Or you could buy some non-dairy yogurt as a like-for-like swap, since you’ll need non-dairy yogurt for the smoothies. The white bean wraps are GF as written!</p><p>If you have any other questions about recipe swaps, don't hesitate to reach out to us: support@workweeklunch.com</p>","tips":"<p><strong>Ready for a super fast and easy prep on Sunday (or your big prep day)?

Dried fruit- dried cranberries or golden raisins would also be good!&nbsp;</p><p><strong>For the Coconut Quinoa Thai Tofu/Shrimp Salad: </strong>Replace quinoa with any grain of your choice. You can swap romaine or kale for the broccoli slaw. Adding fresh chopped avocado will also make this even more filling. There are lots of veggie swap options - read the full recipe notes <a href=\"https://wwlprogram.com/#/recipes/592\">here</a>.</p><p><strong>For the Steak/Tempeh &amp; Spinach Bagel Panini: </strong>You can use any sturdy/thick cut sandwich bread, ciabatta, or even flatbreads. Sirloin, top round, and ribeye are great cuts of meat for this sandwich. Look for something well-marbled, which indicates the meat will be tender. You could also use a shortcut sauce, like a store-bought aioli, dressing, or pesto.</p><p><strong>For the Easy Zucchini Bread for Breakfast or Snacks: </strong>Chopped walnuts, almonds, cashews or dried cranberries would be great add-ins. Turn this into zucchini carrot bread by replacing 1/2 the shredded zucchini with 1/2 a cup of shredded carrots.</p><p><strong>For the Loaded Freezer Burritos:</strong> There are so many options for veggie swaps! The only veggie that wouldn't work (that I can think of) are cucumbers. Chicken sausage, ground beef, steak, and chorizo would all be fantastic protein swaps! If you don't want to use black beans, try pinto!</p><p><strong>Gluten-free swaps:</strong> Make sure your oats are GF for the granola! Swap the soy sauce with tamari for a gluten-free coconut quinoa Thai salad. Select your favorite GF bagels or sturdy bread for the paninis. Don’t forget your favorite GF tortillas for the burritos!</p><p><strong>Dairy-free swaps: </strong>Pick up some vegan butter &amp; dairy-free yogurt for the granola. You’ll use the vegan butter again for the zucchini bread, which will also require vegan chocolate chips! Non-dairy cream cheese is needed for the paninis. Have some dairy-free shredded cheese on hand for the burritos. The coconut quinoa is dairy-free as written!&nbsp;</p><p>If you have any other questions about recipe swaps, don't hesitate to reach out to us: support@workweeklunch.com</p>","tips":"<p><strong>Ready for a super fast and easy prep on Sunday (or your big prep day)?

No problem, you can use craisins, golden raisins, other dried fruit and/or chocolate chips instead!&nbsp;</p><p><strong>For the Antipasto Orzo:</strong> We lean on canned ingredients for this hearty salad, but you can always use fresh!

No worries - you can make muffins, instead. Sub coconut oil or butter for vegetable oil. Not into raspberries? Use strawberries in their place!&nbsp;</p><p><strong>For the Famous Bowls: </strong>There are lots of time-saving swap options for this bowl: use frozen chicken tenders or nuggets, pre-packaged or instant potatoes, jarred gravy and frozen veggies for a quick prep!&nbsp;</p><p><strong>For the Poke Bowls: </strong>Poke bowls are extremely customizable. Swap the veggies, carb, protein or sauce. We recommend reading the <a href=\"https://wwlprogram.com/#/recipes/284\">full recipe notes</a> for inspiration!</p><p><strong>For the Starbucks Wraps: </strong>Since this is a copycat recipe, playing with it too much will make it taste different from the real deal at Starbucks. But it's your kitchen, your rules, so we made a list of swap options <a href=\"https://wwlprogram.com/#/recipes/101\">here</a>. Consider making a double batch for your freezer stash!</p><p><strong>For the Cheeseburger Calzones:</strong> You can easily swap in your favorite store bought pizza dough to make these calzones in half the time. Swap the spinach &amp; tomato with your favorite cooked greens, bell peppers, or mushrooms. If you love pickles on burgers, you can add them, as well. Think of whatever toppings you love on a cheeseburger and feel free to add them! Have fun with it.</p><p><strong>Gluten-free swaps:</strong> You’ll need your favorite GF flour for the doughnuts, famous bowls and calzones! Have some GF breadcrumbs on hand if you’re making homemade tenders for the famous bowls. Swap liquid aminos or tamari for the soy sauce in both the famous bowl and the poke bowl.

This will help prevent the batter from turning purple!</p><p><strong>For the BLATs: </strong>We like Roma tomatoes because they are easy to find, but beefsteak or other large heirloom varieties would work. We used romaine lettuce, but if you prefer iceberg lettuce, butter lettuce, spinach, or sprouts, use those instead. If you don't love avocado, try swapping for hummus or sliced cheese to maintain the moisture barrier. Or, just add mayo to the second slice of bread!&nbsp;</p><p><strong>For the Brussels Sprout Pasta:</strong> If you don’t like sausage, chopped or shredded chicken would be great. Shrimp or white beans could also work! Any pasta shape will work so choose your favorite. We wouldn't recommend omitting the brussels sprouts because they are the star of the show here! However, feel free to add more veggies such as zucchini, broccoli, asparagus, green beans, onion, or shallot.</p><p><strong>For the Chorizo Breakfast Burritos:</strong> Almost any veggies you have lying around in your fridge can work! The Chorizo/Soyrizo gives these breakfast burritos a ton of great flavor, but if this protein isn't your favorite, you can replace it with sausage, bacon, veggie \"meat crumbles\", or black/pinto beans.</p><p><strong>For the Mediterranean Farro Bowls: </strong>It’s super easy to customize these bowls and the options are endless! Read the <a href=\"https://wwlprogram.com/#/recipes/277\">recipe notes</a> for specific protein and veggie swaps. You can even swap out the grain if you don’t care for farro!</p><p><strong>Gluten-free swaps:</strong> For the lemon blueberry scones, use a GF flour blend you trust. All-purpose GF flour works well for me! If your GF flour doesn't have xantham gum, you'll need to add 1/2 a teaspoon for 2 cups of flour. Swap GF bread for the BLATs. When preparing the brussels sprouts pasta use your favorite GF pasta. Use GF tortillas for the burritos, and note that they will hold together best if wrapped right before eating. Finally, swap the farro with quinoa in the mediterranean bowls.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Dairy-free swaps:</strong> To make the lemon blueberry scones dairy-free, use oil and non-dairy milk to sub for heavy cream (2/3 cup rice or soy milk combined with 1/3 cup olive oil or melted dairy-free margarine). The brussels sprouts pasta will need vegan butter in place of dairy butter and nutritional yeast in place of parmesan cheese. Use your favorite dairy free cheese in the breakfast burritos and mediterranean bowls.&nbsp;</p><p>If you have any other questions about recipe swaps, don't hesitate to reach out to us:&nbsp;</p><p>support@workweeklunch.com</p>","tips":"<h2><strong>Meal Prep Multitasking Tips</strong></h2><p><strong>Ready for a super fast and easy prep on Sunday (or your big prep day)?

We love seeing your photos in the</strong><a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/groups/workweekpreppers\"><strong> Workweek Prepper's FB group</strong></a><strong> too.</strong></p><h2><strong>Swap Notes</strong></h2><p><strong>This section will help you customize the recipes based on what you have and what's available.&nbsp;</strong></p><p><strong>For the Breakfast Fried Rice: </strong>Use leftover rice instead of fresh! You can also make this with quinoa. Use sliced or crumbled breakfast sausage or cubed ham instead of (or in addition to) bacon. Omit the meat altogether. Swap out the veggies: carrots, peas, broccoli, cubed potatoes, edamame, onions, shredded cabbage, and zucchini would all be tasty in this recipe.</p><p><strong>For the Roasted Cauliflower, Zucchini and Red Bell Pepper Mac N’ Cheese: </strong>Swap out any <a href=\"https://www.thekitchn.com/how-to-roast-any-vegetable-101221\">veggie that will roast well</a> (which includes most of them). Pro tip: if you're in a rush, go for zucchini, summer squash, tomatoes, asparagus, broccoli, mushrooms and onions -- vegetables that roast quickly. Any \"short\" pasta will work: Penne, macaroni elbows, rotini, ziti, bowtie pasta etc. You could even swap for a protein pasta, like Banza! Speaking of protein, why not add another source like sliced sausage, browned ground meat or shredded chicken? Chickpeas or white beans would be excellent vegetarian/vegan options. Finally, you can change up the cheese. For classic mac n’ cheese you can't go wrong with cheddar, but mozzarella, pepper jack, Monterey jack or even a mixture of these would work great!&nbsp;</p><p><strong>For the Everyday Kale Salad: </strong>Feel free to add protein to this salad! Simple grilled chicken or chickpeas would be my first choice, but really anything could work. If you just don't like feta, swap it out for gorgonzola, blue cheese, or goat cheese! Don’t care for almonds? You can swap for walnuts, cashews, peanuts, seeds, or croutons. Use cranberries or regular raisins in place of golden raisins - or skip them all together. Adding avocado would be a delicious finish!</p><p><strong>For the Bagel Boats:</strong> Mix up the veggies! Kale, onions, bell pepper, broccoli, and tomatoes would all be great swaps for this savory breakfast creation. Feel free to switch up the protein or add a little bit more. Cooked bacon, sausage, tempeh, or your favorite vegan meat alternative would add more bulk to these boats.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>For the 30-Minute Soba Noodle Stir Fry: </strong>Stir Fry customizations are super easy and the options are endless! Read the recipe notes for specific protein and veggie swaps. You can also switch up the noodles!</p><p><strong>Gluten-free swaps: </strong>Use tamari or liquid aminos instead of soy sauce for the breakfast fried rice and the soba noodle salad. Select your favorite GF pasta &amp; breadcrumbs for the mac n’ cheese, as well as GF flour! Swap out gluten-free bagels for the bagel boats.</p><p><strong>Dairy-free swaps: </strong>For the roasted veggie mac n’ cheese, you’ll need dairy free butter, nutritional yeast in place of parmesan and shredded non-dairy cheese (any kind!). You’ll use the shredded non-dairy cheese again later in the week for the bagel boats. Pick up some non-dairy crumbled cheese (like vegan feta) for the kale salads.</p><p>If you have any other questions about recipe swaps, don't hesitate to reach out to us:&nbsp;</p><p>support@workweeklunch.com</p>","tips":"<h2><strong>Meal Prep Multitasking Tips</strong></h2><p><strong>Ready for a super fast and easy prep on Sunday (or your big prep day)?

Add in some shredded cheese or nutritional yeast if you like.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>For the Loaded Baked Potatoes: </strong>See the notes in this recipe for all the different topping ideas, you can get really creative with these and use up what you already have!&nbsp;</p><p><strong>For the Butternut Squash Soup: </strong>Customize your toppings by using a different bean, pita chips, or croutons on top instead. Add a swirl of the milk you used once in the containers for added creaminess.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>For the Creamy Garlic Pasta: </strong>Use whatever roasted veggies you like for this! Sweet potatoes, beets, and zucchini would all be great because you would use up the whole thing and keep it low waste.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Gluten-free swaps:</strong> Make sure to use gluten-free oats and flour for the blueberry crisp. Use gluten-free flour for the blueberry crisp, zucchini fritters, loaded baked potatoes, and creamy garlic pasta. Pick up your favorite GF pasta for the creamy garlic pasta.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Dairy-free swaps: </strong>Use dairy-free butter and yogurt for the blueberry crisp, and dairy-free milk for the loaded baked potatoes, butternut squash soup, and creamy garlic pasta.

Ground turkey, ground Italian sausage, or ground chicken would work for the omnivore version. For the veg versions, impossible meat, or your other favorite plant-based ground meat. You could also use 15 oz canned beans, drained and mashed.</p><p><strong>Gluten-free swaps:</strong> Make sure to grab GF oats for the granola! You will need gluten-free flour for the pancakes. You will need to use GF noodles as well as liquid aminos (to replace soy sauce) in the soup. Grab GF tortillas for the farmer's market quesadillas. Make sure you have GF pasta or gluten-free bread depending on which recipe you choose to make for the meatballs! You will also need GF bread crumbs for these as well.</p><p><strong>Dairy-free swaps: </strong>Grab non-dairy yogurt to enjoy with your pumpkin spice granola!

Notes</strong></h2><p><strong>This section will help you customize the recipes based on what you have and what's available.&nbsp;</strong></p><p><strong>For the Scallion Pancakes: </strong>Use whatever veggies you have on hand. Shredded cabbage, zucchini, chopped kale/greens, mushrooms, bell peppers, hot chilies. Even cooked leftover veggies will work in this recipe.</p><p><strong>For the Overnight Oats: </strong>Feel free to add more chopped-up fruit to these oats! Other add-ins such as chia seeds, coconut flakes, chopped nuts, or crushed graham crackers would be delicious.</p><p><strong>For the Orzo Skillet: </strong>Chicken/ veg sausage is the easiest, but you can also use chicken breast, turkey breast, any other kind of sausage, ground meat, tempeh, or chickpeas. Add in any other seasonal produce you enjoy as well!</p><p><strong>For the Fajitas: </strong>If you aren't into bell peppers, try sliced cabbage, zucchini, carrots, or mushrooms. Swap steak and tempeh for shredded chicken, shrimp, tofu strips or portobello mushrooms.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>For the Egg Roll in a Bowl: </strong>Not feeling rice? You can use any grain or even noodles of your choice for this meal. We used a bag of coleslaw mix for this, but you can chop up your favorite fresh veggies such as cabbage, carrots, zucchini, edamame, snap peas, onion, green beans, etc!</p><p><strong>Gluten-free swaps:</strong> Use an all-purpose GF flour for the scallion pancakes. Make sure to grab GF oats for the overnight oats. Use GF orzo or a short GF pasta for the orzo skillet. You will need GF tortillas for the fajitas, we love Mission Brand. Sub soy sauce for liquid aminos or tamari in the egg roll in a bowl.</p><p><strong>Dairy-free swaps: </strong>Make sure you have your favorite non-dairy milk and non-dairy vanilla yogurt for the overnight oats.
